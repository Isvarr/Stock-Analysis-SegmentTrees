//A Segment Tree is a versatile and efficient tree-based data structure used to store information about intervals or segments.
//Its primary application is to allow for fast querying (like finding the sum, minimum, or maximum) over a specific range within an array, and fast updating of elements in the array. 
//It's particularly useful when both range queries and single-point updates are frequent operations.
